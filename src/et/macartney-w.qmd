Introverted traits are not necessarily detrimental to teamwork, some can even be assets. Embracing introverted traits can help the team, by letting you work at your best, and help the team, by bringing new teamwork styles. It is important to communicate with those you are working with about your introverted traits so that you can plan and adapt around those traits. This might mean changing how your team works. It is important to be open minded and adaptable.
